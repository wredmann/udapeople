### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

# commands:
#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...
